sdl2_nim 2.0.14.2
=================

***

ATTENTION!
==========
> Due to a name conflict with the `nim-lang/sdl2` wrapper, sdl2_nim will transition from `sdl2` to `sdl2_nim` directory. See [issue #35](https://github.com/Vladar4/sdl2_nim/issues/35) and [Nim issue #18476](https://github.com/nim-lang/Nim/issues/18476).
>
> To update your projects you'll just need to replace `import sdl2/...` statements with `import sdl2_nim/...`.
>
> To use legacy `import sdl2/...` statements, install `legacy` branch (`nimble install sdl2_nim@#legacy`).

FAQ:
====
**Q**: Why does this exist if there's an official [nim-lang/sdl2](https://github.com/nim-lang/sdl2) repository?

**A**: This wrapper actually was created before the official (Aug. 2013 vs. Mar. 2014). Maybe I wouldn't have made it if there already was a wrapper at the time.

**Q**: How is it different from the official wrapper?

**A**: Obviously, it can't be *much* different, as they both are wrappers for the same library, but what comes to mind:

* This one is fully documented, nim-style, with the generated documentation as a bonus;
* I personally created a series of highly commented examples for almost every aspect of the library and its "satelites" (gfx, ttf, etc.);
* Design decisions that I thought made more sense than official one's (like Event type through {.union.} vs. evConv template with casting; naming sceme closer to the original sdl2, etc.);
* Source files' structure is closely following the original library.

**Q**: Why should I use this one vs. the official?

**A**: No reason. It's a question of preference.

**Q**: Where could I find smpeg2.dll?

**A**: It is distributed within SDL2_mixer 2.0.1 and older builds.

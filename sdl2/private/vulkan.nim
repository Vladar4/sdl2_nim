proc vulkanLoadLibrary*(path: cstring): cint {.
    cdecl, importc: "SDL_Vulkan_LoadLibrary", dynlib: SDL2_LIB.}
  ##  Dynamically load a Vulkan loader library.
  ##
  ##  ``path`` The platform dependent Vulkan loader library name, or `nil`.
  ##
  ##  ``Return`` `0` on success, or `-1` if the library couldn't be loaded.
  ##
  ##  If ``path`` is `nil` SDL will use the value of the environment variable
  ##  ``SDL_VULKAN_LIBRARY``, if set, otherwise it loads the default Vulkan
  ##  loader library.
  ##
  ##  This should be called after initializing the video driver, but before
  ##  creating any Vulkan windows. If no Vulkan loader library is loaded, the
  ##  default library will be loaded upon creation of the first Vulkan window.
  ##
  ##  ``Note:`` It is fairly common for Vulkan applications to link with
  ##  ``libvulkan`` instead of explicitly loading it at run time. This will
  ##  work with SDL provided the application links to a dynamic library and
  ##  both it and SDL use the same search path.
  ##
  ##  ``Note:`` If you specify a non-`nil` ``path``, an application should
  ##  retrieve all of the Vulkan procedures it uses from the dynamic library
  ##  using ``vulkanGetVkGetInstanceProcAddr()`` unless you can guarantee
  ##  ``path`` points to the same vulkan loader library the application
  ##  linked to.
  ##
  ##  ``Note:`` On Apple devices, if ``path`` is `nil`, SDL will attempt to find
  ##  the ``vkGetInstanceProcAddr`` address within all the mach-o images of
  ##  the current process. This is because it is fairly common for Vulkan
  ##  applications to link with libvulkan (and historically MoltenVK was
  ##  provided as a static library). If it is not found then, on macOS, SDL
  ##  will attempt to load ``vulkan.framework/vulkan``, ``libvulkan.1.dylib``,
  ##  followed by ``libvulkan.dylib``, in that order.
  ##  On iOS SDL will attempt to load ``libvulkan.dylib`` only. Applications
  ##  using a dynamic framework or .dylib must ensure it is included in its
  ##  application bundle.
  ##
  ##  ``Note`` On non-Apple devices, application linking with a static
  ##  libvulkan is not supported. Either do not link to the Vulkan loader or
  ##  link to a dynamic library version.
  ##
  ##  ``Note:`` This procedures will fail if there are no working Vulkan drivers
  ##  installed.

proc vulkanGetVkGetInstanceProcAddr*(): pointer {.
    cdecl, importc: "SDL_Vulkan_GetVkGetInstanceProcAddr", dynlib: SDL2_LIB.}
  ##  Get the address of the ``vkGetInstanceProcAddr`` procedure.
  ##
  ##  ``Note:`` This should be called after either calling ``vulkanLoadLibrary``
  ##  or creating an SDL_Window with the `WINDOW_VULKAN` flag.

proc vulkanUnloadLibrary*() {.
    cdecl, importc: "SDL_Vulkan_UnloadLibrary", dynlib: SDL2_LIB.}
  ##  Unload the Vulkan loader library previously loaded by
  ##  ``vulkanLoadLibrary()``.

proc vulkanGetInstanceExtensions*(
    window: Window; pCount: ptr cuint; pNames: cstringArray): bool {.
    cdecl, importc: "SDL_Vulkan_GetInstanceExtensions", dynlib: SDL2_LIB.}
  ##  Get the names of the Vulkan instance extensions needed to create
  ##  a surface with ``vulkan_CreateSurface()``.
  ##
  ##  ``window`` `nil` or window for which the required Vulkan instance
  ##  extensions should be retrieved.
  ##
  ##  ``pCount`` Pointer to an ``cuint`` related to the number of
  ##  required Vulkan instance extensions.
  ##
  ##  ``pNames`` `nil` or a pointer to an array to be filled with the
  ##  required Vulkan instance extensions.
  ##
  ##  ``Return`` `true` on success, `false` on error.
  ##
  ##  If ``pNames`` is `nil`, then the number of required Vulkan instance
  ##  extensions is returned in ``pCount``. Otherwise, ``pCount`` must point
  ##  to a variable set to the number of elements in the ``pNames`` array,
  ##  and on return the variable is overwritten with the number of names
  ##  actually written to ``pNames``. If ``pCount`` is less than the number
  ##  of required extensions, at most ``pCount`` structures will be written.
  ##  If ``pCount`` is smaller than the number of required extensions,
  ##  `0` will be returned instead `1`, to indicate that not all the required
  ##  extensions were returned.
  ##
  ##  ``Note:`` If ``window`` is not `nil`, it will be checked against its
  ##  creation flags to ensure that the Vulkan flag is present. This parameter
  ##  will be removed in a future major release.
  ##
  ##  ``Note:`` The returned list of extensions will contain VK_KHR_surface
  ##  and zero or more platform specific extensions
  ##
  ##  ``Note:`` The extension names queried here must be enabled when calling
  ##  ``vkCreateInstance``, otherwise surface creation will fail.
  ##
  ##  ``Note:`` ``window`` should have been created with the
  ##  `WINDOW_VULKAN` flag or be `nil`.

  ##  ``w``       Pointer to variable for storing the width in pixels,

  ##  ``h``       Pointer to variable for storing the height in pixels,

  ##
  ##  This may differ from ``getWindowSize()`` if we're rendering to a high-DPI
  ##  drawable, i.e. the window was created with `WINDOW_ALLOW_HIGHDPI` on a
  ##  platform with high-DPI support (Apple calls this "Retina"),
  ##  and not disabled by the `HINT_VIDEO_HIGHDPI_DISABLED` hint.
  ##
  ##  ``Note:`` On macOS high-DPI support must be enabled for an application by
  ##  setting ``NSHighResolutionCapable`` to `true` in its ``Info.plist``.
